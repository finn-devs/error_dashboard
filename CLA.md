# error-dashboard Contributor License Agreement
Version 1.0, February 2026

**Project:** error-dashboard  
**Copyright Holder:** Frederick Finn / Finn Devs

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Purpose

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") defines the terms under which
You contribute to error-dashboard. It protects You as a contributor by making
your rights explicit, and it protects Frederick Finn / Finn Devs ("the
Maintainer") by establishing clear ownership and licensing terms that allow
the project to be maintained, developed, and commercially licensed without
legal ambiguity.

By submitting a Contribution to error-dashboard, You agree to the terms of this
Agreement.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 1. Definitions

**"You"** means the individual or legal entity submitting a Contribution.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any
modifications or additions to existing work, that You intentionally submit to
error-dashboard by any means, including pull requests, patches, issues containing
code, or any other form of communication to the Maintainer or the project
repository.

**"Submit"** means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication
sent to the Maintainer or the project repository, including but not limited to
pull requests, issues, and forum posts.

- Use Your Contributions in any current or future version of error-dashboard;
- License Your Contributions under any license, including commercial licenses,

     under commercial licenses issued by the Maintainer.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 5. No Obligation to Accept

The Maintainer is under no obligation to accept, review, or include any

for Your Contributions, including in cases where the Maintainer commercially
licenses the Software incorporating Your Contributions.
